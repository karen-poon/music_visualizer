## LED Strip controlled by Mic and Bluetooth
This is to test how the microphone can change the number of LEDs lighting up, 
and use an app to control the colour of the whole LED strip through bluetooth.

There is an issue with this code right now: bluetooth shuts down automatically after a while whenever I have the mic running.
I am suspecting that it's due to the fact that the Arudino cannot handle too many things happening at the same time.
