## Operating LED Strip with Bluetooth
This is to test how to change the colour of the LED strip through bluetooth.

An app is created through MIT App Inventor, which sends signals to the Arduino through bluetooth. 
When user selects a colour on the app, the data of the selected colour (RGB colour numbers) will be sent to the Arduino one by one.
A linked list is created in the code to organize data in a systematic way.
